### THIS PACK *REQUIRES* [EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features "EMF") AND [ETF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures "ETF") (Optifine may work as well!)
------------

**THIS PROJECT DOES NOT USE ACTIONS & STUFF ASSETS, IT SIMPLY REPLICATES THEM. PLEASE SUPPORT OREVILLE STUDIOS BY PURCHASING [ACTIONS & STUFF](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace/pdp/oreville-studios/actions--stuff-1.4/61c7a786-d7ad-49e0-a710-817121cd9795 "ACTIONS & STUFF") VIA THE MICROSOFT STORE/MINECRAFT MARKETPLACE.**

A&S Inspired Additions & Tweaks is a Java Edition resource pack that adds and tweaks models and textures into resembling those seen in the Actions & Stuff texture pack for Bedrock Edition in the vanilla artstyle. **(THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE ANIMATION!)**

> *Note: This isn't really compatible with Fresh Animations yet, but I plan on doing that some time soon in the future!
> Note 2: Yes, this will be updated to future versions, 1.21.5 is just what I'm working on right now because bored*
